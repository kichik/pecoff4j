  Executable-File Header Format (3.1)
 ฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿
An executable (.EXE) file for the Windows operating system contains a
combination of code and data or a combination of code, data, and resources.
The executable file also contains two headers: an MS-DOS header and a
Windows header. The next two sections describe these headers; the third
section describes the code and data contained in a Windows executable file.

 MS-DOS Header
 ฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿
The MS-DOS (old-style) executable-file header contains four distinct parts:
a collection of header information (such as the signature word, the file
size, and so on), a reserved section, a pointer to a Windows header (if one
exists), and a stub program.

If the word value at offset 18h is 40h or greater, the word value at 3Ch is
typically an offset to a Windows header. Applications must verify this for
each executable-file header being tested, because a few applications have a
different header style.

MS-DOS uses the stub program to display a message if Windows has not been
loaded when the user attempts to run a program.

 Windows Header
 ฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿
The Windows (new-style) executable-file header contains information that the
loader requires for segmented executable files. This information includes
the linker version number, data specified by the linker, data specified by
the resource compiler, tables of segment data, tables of resource data, and
so on. The following illustration shows the Windows executable-file header:

The following sections describe the entries in the Windows executable-file
header.

 Information Block
 ฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿
The information block in the Windows header contains the linker version
number, the lengths of various tables that further describe the executable
file, the offsets from the beginning of the header to the beginning of these
tables, the heap and stack sizes, and so on. The following list summarizes
the contents of the header information block (the locations are relative to
the beginning of the block):

  00h     ณ Specifies the signature word. The low byte contains "N" (4Eh)
          ณ and the high byte contains "E" (45h).
          ณ
  02h     ณ Specifies the linker version number.
          ณ
  03h     ณ Specifies the linker revision number.
          ณ
  04h     ณ Specifies the offset to the entry table (relative to the
          ณ beginning of the header).
          ณ
  06h     ณ Specifies the length of the entry table, in bytes.
          ณ
  08h     ณ Reserved.
          ณ
  0Ch     ณ Specifies flags that describe the contents of the executable
          ณ file. This value can be one or more of the following bits:

          ณ  0  ณ The linker sets this bit if the executable-file format is
          ณ     ณ SINGLEDATA. An executable file with this format contains
          ณ     ณ one data segment. This bit is set if the file is a
          ณ     ณ dynamic-link library (DLL).
          ณ     ณ
          ณ  1  ณ The linker sets this bit if the executable-file format is
          ณ     ณ MULTIPLEDATA. An executable file with this format
          ณ     ณ contains multiple data segments. This bit is set if the
          ณ     ณ file is a Windows application.
          ณ     ณ
          ณ     ณ If neither bit 0 nor bit 1 is set, the executable-file
          ณ     ณ format is NOAUTODATA. An executable file with this format

          ณ     ณ
          ณ     ณ If bit 15 is set, the CS:IP registers point to an
          ณ     ณ initialization procedure called with the value in the AX
          ณ     ณ register equal to the module handle. The initialization
          ณ     ณ procedure must execute a far return to the caller. If the
          ณ     ณ procedure is successful, the value in AX is nonzero.
          ณ     ณ Otherwise, the value in AX is zero.
          ณ     ณ
          ณ     ณ The value in the DS register is set to the library's data
          ณ     ณ segment if SINGLEDATA is set. Otherwise, DS is set to the
          ณ     ณ data segment of the application that loads the library.
          ณ
  0Eh     ณ Specifies the automatic data segment number. (0Eh is zero if the
          ณ SINGLEDATA and MULTIPLEDATA bits are cleared.)
          ณ
  10h     ณ Specifies the initial size, in bytes, of the local heap. This
          ณ value is zero if there is no local allocation.
          ณ
  12h     ณ Specifies the initial size, in bytes, of the stack. This value
          ณ is zero if the SS register value does not equal the DS register
          ณ value.
          ณ
  14h     ณ Specifies the segment:offset value of CS:IP.
          ณ
  18h     ณ Specifies the segment:offset value of SS:SP.
          ณ

          ณ table. The first entry in the segment table corresponds to
          ณ segment number 1.
          ณ
          ณ If SS addresses the automatic data segment and SP is zero, SP
          ณ is set to the address obtained by adding the size of the

Following are the members in the NAMEINFO structure:

 rnOffset ณ Specifies an offset to the contents of the resource data
          ณ (relative to the beginning of the file). The offset is in terms
          ณ of alignment units specified by the rscAlignShift member at
          ณ the beginning of the resource table.
          ณ

 Resident-Name Table
 ฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿
The resident-name table contains strings that identify exported functions in
the executable file. As the name implies, these strings are resident in
system memory and are never discarded. The resident-name strings are
case-sensitive and are not null-terminated. The following list summarizes
the values found in the resident-name table (the locations are relative to
the beginning of each entry):

 Location  ณ Description
 ออออออออออุออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
   00h     ณ Specifies the length of a string. If there are no more strings
           ณ in the table, this value is zero.
           ณ
 01h - xxh ณ Specifies the resident-name text. This string is case-sensitive
           ณ and is not null-terminated.
           ณ
 xxh + 01h ณ Specifies an ordinal number that identifies the string. This
           ณ number is an index into the entry table.

The first string in the resident-name table is the module name.

 Module-Reference Table
 ฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿
The module-reference table contains offsets for module names stored in the
imported-name table. Each entry in this table is 2 bytes long.

 Imported-Name Table
 ฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿
The imported-name table contains the names of modules that the executable
file imports. Each entry contains two parts: a single byte that specifies
the length of the string and the string itself. The strings in this table
are not null-terminated.

 Entry Table
 ฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿
The entry table contains bundles of entry points from the executable file
(the linker generates each bundle). The numbering system for these ordinal
values is 1-based--that is, the ordinal value corresponding to the first
entry point is 1.

The linker generates the densest possible bundles under the restriction that
it cannot reorder the entry points. This restriction is necessary because
other executable files may refer to entry points within a given bundle by
their ordinal values.

The entry-table data is organized by bundle, each of which begins with a
2-byte header. The first byte of the header specifies the number of entries
in the bundle (a value of 00h designates the end of the table). The second
byte specifies whether the corresponding segment is movable or fixed. If the
value in this byte is 0FFh, the segment is movable.

If the value in this byte is 0FEh, the entry does not refer to a segment
but refers, instead, to a constant defined within the module. If the value
in this byte is neither 0FFh nor 0FEh, it is a segment index.

For movable segments, each entry consists of 6 bytes and has the following
form:

 Location ณ Description
 อออออออออุอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ

          ณ   0    ณ If this bit is set, the entry is exported.
          ณ        ณ
          ณ   1    ณ If this bit is set, the segment uses a global (shared)
          ณ        ณ data segment.
          ณ        ณ
          ณ  3-7   ณ If the executable file contains code that performs
          ณ        ณ ring transitions, these bits specify the number of
          ณ        ณ words that compose the stack. At the time of the ring
          ณ        ณ transition, these words must be copied from one ring
          ณ        ณ to the other.
          ณ

          ณ        ณ
          ณ  1     ณ If this bit is set, the entry uses a global (shared)
          ณ        ณ data segment. (This may be set only for SINGLEDATA
          ณ        ณ library modules.)
          ณ        ณ
          ณ 3-7    ณ If the executable file contains code that performs

          ณ        ณ to the other.
          ณ
  01h     ณ Specifies an offset.

 Nonresident-Name Table
 ฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿
The nonresident-name table contains strings that identify exported functions
in the executable file. As the name implies, these strings are not always
resident in system memory and are discardable. The nonresident-name strings
are case-sensitive; they are not null-terminated. The following list
summarizes the values found in the nonresident-name table (the specified
locations are relative to the beginning of each entry):

 Location  ณ Description
 ออออออออออุอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
  00h      ณ Specifies the length, in bytes, of a string. If this byte is
           ณ 00h, there are no more strings in the table.
           ณ
 01h - xxh ณ Specifies the nonresident-name text. This string is
           ณ case-sensitive and is not null-terminated.
           ณ
 xx + 01h  ณ Specifies an ordinal number that is an index to the entry
           ณ table.

The first name that appears in the nonresident-name table is the module
description string (which was specified in the module-definition file).

 Code Segments and Relocation Data
 ฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿
Code and data segments follow the Windows header. Some of the code segments
may contain calls to functions in other segments and may, therefore, require
relocation data to resolve those references. This relocation data is stored
in a relocation table that appears immediately after the code or data in the
segment.

The first 2 bytes in this table specify the number of relocation
items the table contains. A relocation item is a collection of bytes
specifying the following information:

  Address type (segment only, offset only, segment and offset)
  Relocation type (internal reference, imported ordinal, imported name)
  Segment number or ordinal identifier (for internal references)
  Reference-table index or function ordinal number (for imported ordinals)
  Reference-table index or name-table offset (for imported names)

Each relocation item contains 8 bytes of data, the first byte of which
specifies one of the following relocation-address types:

 Value ณ Meaning
 ออออออุอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
   0   ณ Low byte at the specified offset
       ณ
   2   ณ 16-bit selector
       ณ
   3   ณ 32-bit pointer
       ณ
   5   ณ 16-bit offset
       ณ
  11   ณ 48-bit pointer
       ณ
  13   ณ 32-bit offset

The second byte specifies one of the following relocation types:

 Value ณ Meaning
 ออออออุอออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
   0   ณ Internal reference
       ณ
   1   ณ Imported ordinal
       ณ
   2   ณ Imported name
       ณ
   3   ณ OSFIXUP

The third and fourth bytes specify the offset of the relocation item within
the segment.

If the relocation type is imported ordinal, the fifth and sixth bytes
specify an index to a module's reference table and the seventh and eighth
bytes specify a function ordinal value.

If the relocation type is imported name, the fifth and sixth bytes specify
an index to a module's reference table and the seventh and eighth bytes
specify an offset to an imported-name table.

If the relocation type is internal reference and the segment is fixed, the
fifth byte specifies the segment number, the sixth byte is zero, and the
seventh and eighth bytes specify an offset to the segment. If the relocation
type is internal reference and the segment is movable, the fifth byte
specifies 0FFh, the sixth byte is zero; and the seventh and eighth bytes
specify an ordinal value found in the segment's entry table.
